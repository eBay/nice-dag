## What is nice-dag-core?

`nice-dag-core` creates and maintains an easy-to-use DOM structure for visualising **DAG Diagram**. The positions of nodes and lines are calculated based on [Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre), while the rendering logic is controlled by developers in the manner of **JS APIs**.

Besides DAG diagram layout, it also provides build-in functions for **Flow Editor** interactions like **dragging**, **dropping**, creating or removing nodes and edges. Developers can use these functions according to their customized use cases. 

Ideally, `nice-dag-core` is framework agnostic. But for the current version, `nice-dag-core` should be used with [nice-dag-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ebay/nice-dag-react).
